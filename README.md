Emergency Mode – Panic Protection App
Idea

Emergency Mode is a mobile, emergency-only app designed for moments of panic such as disasters, protests, accidents, or medical emergencies. The app focuses on clarity and fast decision-making, helping users take immediate action without overthinking.

Key Design Decisions

Single Primary Action:
The Help screen prioritizes one main action—calling emergency services—to reduce hesitation and decision fatigue during high-stress situations.

Automatic Location Sharing:
Location is shared automatically to remove extra steps and ensure accurate information reaches responders quickly.

Condition-Based Guidance:
Instead of emergency categories, the app provides guidance based on the user’s condition (feeling unsafe, able to move, or needing medical help), which is easier to assess under stress.

Family Contact as Secondary:
Notifying family or emergency contacts is available but secondary, ensuring professional help is always prioritized.

No Emergency Categories:
Avoiding event labels keeps the interface simple and usable across different emergency scenarios.

This design minimizes cognitive load and helps users act quickly and confidently during emergencies.
